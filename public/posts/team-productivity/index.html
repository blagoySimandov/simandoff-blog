  "articleBody": " In software engineering, we are often pressured by deadlines. As programmers, we are tasked with solving complex problems quickly. And although computers don’t make mistakes, we as programmers are still human, and a bug or two inevitably slips into our code. But as all great teams know, there’s a process designed to catch and correct these issues — Code Review.\nCode Review is an integral process for any software project, and it’s the steady flow of pull requests keeping a codebase alive and evolving.\nWhen working on a project dear to us, we can become overly scrupulous or emotionally attached to a codebase. That can lead us to extremes, like blocking PRs over minor issues—renaming a variable, extracting a function, or refactoring code for style. While these concerns may be valid in the long term, they are rarely good enough to block a pull request.\nPRs are like blood flowing through a codebase. If you block them unnecessarily, the entire system slows down and stagnates. And just like in a living organism, it’s far healthier to keep the blood flowing continuously—even if it’s not perfectly clean—than to hold everything up waiting for perfection.\nA team is like a living CPU Just like a CPU is composed of multiple threads working in parallel, a team is an organic system made up of individual engineers, each contributing to a common mission: improving the codebase and moving the product forward.\nAnd just like how CPUs can suffer from race conditions and deadlocks due to poor sync, teams, too, can fall into productivity traps when members become blocked.\nIn a team of 5 people, the moment a member is blocked waiting for a PR review, the impact is bigger than just a 20% slow down (which by itself is a lot). The blocked work might delay integration, slow testing, or create merge conflicts that snowball into bigger issues and even more possible blockages.\nThis is why velocity matters.\nUnblocking a teammate with a quick PR review is often a far better use of the next 15 minutes than continuing to bang your head against a stubborn bug.\nReviews Help, Pedantic Reviews Hurt Reviews help teams move forward. But pedantic reviews are unhelpful and actually harm a team’s performance. Pedantic reviews spin up a chain reaction which can lead to a cycle of synchronization problems, each time having to ping the other engineer, each time having to context switch and lose a little bit of energy and focus. This leads to frustration and slows the process for no reason. In most cases, your 80% good-enough PR reviewed quickly contributes more than a 100% polished one merged two days later.\nLet’s walk through what happens when you leave a “minor” comment on a pull request—say, something like “Please rename this variable to something more descriptive.”\nOn the surface, it feels harmless. It might even seem helpful\nBut under the hood, you’ve just set off a chain of events that will slow down the entire team:\nThe developer needs to see your comment.\nMaybe they get the notification right away. Maybe they’re deep in a different task and won’t check their notifications for hours. Sometimes, it’s the next day.\nThey have to switch context.\nEven if it’s just a small change, the dev now has to pause whatever they’re working on, reload the mental state of the original PR, and figure out how to address your comment.\nBest-case scenario: they’re indifferent to the change and just rename the variable.\nWorst case: they disagree, feel frustrated, and now a simple review turns into a pointless debate over subjective naming preferences that might not even last until the next quarter.\nThey make the change and ping you again.\nNow the dev has to re-request review or tag you directly. Depending on your availability, you might not reply immediately. That adds even more idle time.\nThe PR is blocked until you approve.\nThe PR is blocked, and the team is not moving. That means feature work, bug fixes, or integrations, depending on this PR, also stay blocked. Merge conflicts (the bane of my existence) might get created as a result of that\nA simple comment can cause an avalanche of problems.\nTaking a look at the PR process A PR would have requested changes of only two types:\nThe PR includes changes that would either not work correctly, or even if they do, the code being merged would result in the overall health of the codebase degrading. Changes that try to bring up a PR’s quality unnecessarily. The second scenario is the one we need to be wary of.\nIf a PR is good enough so that merging it will positively impact the codebase, we should have no reason to block it.\nIf you have some considerations around the implementation that can better clean up the code or even refactor certain parts, create a ticket.\nThe ticket can then be triaged and prioritized appropriately by the team, and now the team holds the power to decide whether refactoring is worth their time in this current moment. If it is, great, pick up the ticket and do the work; otherwise, shove the ticket into the backlog until it’s time comes.\nAnd if you feel like you cannot be bothered to cut a ticket for small changes like renaming a variable, ask yourself - If a change is not worth the trouble to create a ticket for, is it really worth blocking a PR over it?\nConclusion Move the work across. Merge the PR. File a ticket for improvements if needed. Don’t let perfect be the enemy of shipped\n",
