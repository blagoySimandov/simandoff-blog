There is one thing that is certain: If there is code, that code is prone to
break.

In today's AI age, where programmers can generate hundreds of lines of code
within minutes, we must remember that more code isn't always the best solution.
As a project's codebase grows, system complexity increases—and with each line
added, there's a hidden maintenance cost lurking in the background. You might
not feel it now or tomorrow, but eventually, you'll look at the system and ask
yourself, "Why?" Why does this simple dialog box need 2,000 lines of code? Why
does a basic file upload button require so many engineering hours just for
programmers to understand what it does?

Although this has been a problem for years, only in recent years has the idea of
"code explosion" truly taken off.

## Code Explosion

A study by
[IT Revolution](https://itrevolution.com/articles/new-research-reveals-ai-coding-assistants-boost-developer-productivity-by-26-what-it-leaders-need-to-know/#:~:text=Code%20Volume%20and%20Iteration%20Speed,a%20more%20agile%20development%20process)
reveals that ever since AI came onto the scene, developer "productivity" has
increased—if productivity is measured by the number of lines of code added to a
project.

Junior developers have improved their code output by 21% to 40%, while senior
developers show a more modest 7% to 16% increase.

I cannot argue against the fact that AI assistants help programmers iterate more
quickly—that is an undeniable fact. What I do believe, though, is that after
generating a working iteration, programmers often lack the motivation to
refactor, clean up, or even fully understand and simplify the code. This can
lead to an "AI-driven development" style, especially with tools like Cursor’s
agent/composer, which practically drive the development process.

Since AI tools generate code so quickly and often produce overly verbose
implementations, the end result tends to be difficult to read and maintain. It
becomes a tangled mess—understandable in isolation but convoluted when
considering the bigger picture. This is much like how AI-generated text can be
technically correct yet say little of real substance.

## A Cry for Minimalism

Although AI assistants speed up development, I firmly believe that one should
not entrust a codebase’s architectural decisions to an AI model.

Programming is not just about creating something that works—it’s about creating
something that is maintainable and understandable. A 700-line file, mostly
generated by AI, is rarely easy to read.

When programmers make decisions themselves, their natural inclination toward
efficiency (a good thing in this context) often leads them to more minimal and
elegant solutions. These solutions are typically easier for fellow programmers
to read and understand, taking a fraction of the time compared to deciphering an
AI-generated behemoth.

## Not Everything Needs to Be Code (or at Least Our Code)

As programmers, we are often tempted to solve a problem by writing custom code.
Whether it’s a complex calculation or an innovative workflow that connects
GitHub to Slack in a way not natively supported, we instinctively reach for
code.

While these projects can be fun, in a corporate setting, they might not be
ideal. The moment we add code, we own it. We need to maintain it. Others may
depend on it. Requirements change. Bugs emerge. The overhead increases.

An alternative is to seek minimal-code or no-code solutions. Instead of creating
a CLI tool for some calculation, use Excel. You can still inject data via code
but avoid handling complex calculations within your codebase. Instead of
developing a custom workflow with webhooks, use a tool like
[Make.com](http://make.com/) to generate the workflow and call it from your app.

You will always need code—but it’s better when you are not the one who has to
maintain all of it.

## Conclusion

Minimalism is not about avoiding code; it’s about making smart decisions about
when and how to use it. AI tools can be powerful assistants, but they should not
dictate our software’s architecture. The best systems are those that balance
automation with human insight, complexity with simplicity, and speed with
maintainability. Before writing a single line of code, consider whether there is
a simpler way. And if you must code, write only what is necessary—because every
additional line is another potential point of failure.
