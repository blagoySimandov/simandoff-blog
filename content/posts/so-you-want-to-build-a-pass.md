Everyone’s heard of SaaS — _Software as a Service_. But have you heard of
**PasS**. And no, we’re not talking about _Platform as a Service_ — that’s
so 2020. We’re talking about **Prompt as a Service**.

Got a problem you wanted to solve, but AI already did 90% of the job for you?

**Build a PasS.**

Wrap your single ChatGPT prompt in a half-decent UI — obviously vibe-coded in
React — and watch the clicks and downloads flood your landing page. Then, mount
your high horse and craft a quick LinkedIn post about how agentic AI is changing
the world, and how your new startup _BusinessPlanAI_ is set to disrupt the $19
billion business plan market (a number ChatGPT generously made up while hyping
your pitch deck).

Slap on your Prompt Engineer™ hat and refine that business-plan-generating
prompt until even the sharpest VC can’t tell it’s smoke and mirrors. Not that it
matters — your product has “AI” in the name.

Congratulations. You’re now an AI Guru™ / CEO / Entrepreneur. Time to update
LinkedIn.

Start posting visionary threads about the glorious AI future. And don’t forget
to remind everyone — every 3 months — that all software engineers will be
obsolete within 6 months. (We’re currently on year 2.5 of that timeline.)

But let’s not daydream just yet.

As responsible ~~engineers~~ _prompt engineers_, we must tackle this
methodically.

---

### **Step 1: Get a business idea**

Fire up ChatGPT and ~~ask~~ prompt the age-old question:

**“How do I get rich quick with an AI SaaS?”**

(Prompt as a Service still isn’t mainstream, but one day…)

---

### **Step 2: Vibe-code the frontend**

Subscribe to Claude Code Pro for $200/month and let it vibe-code your UI.

Spin up 15 agents for 36 hours and voilà — a beautifully inconsistent React app
is born.

And you know you are doing good when you got `useEffect` on every second line.

---

### **Step 3: Connect-the-dots backend with n8n**

Install n8n like a real AI Bro and start dragging nodes until you’ve got
something vaguely backend-ish. Sure, it barely works, but who cares — we’re
building a Prompt-as-a-Service, not a launch system for SpaceX.

---

### **Step 4: Time to raise capital**

March into a VC meeting and DEMO. THE. PROMPTING.

But don’t pitch it as a “Prompt as a Service”. Instead, call it:

**“Agentic AI Crypto Big Data B2B SaaS for disrupting the X industry.”**

There’s no need to prep for questions — they’ll tune out right after “Agentic
AI.”

---

### **Step 5: Become the AI Thought Leader You Were Meant to Be**

LinkedIn is now your battlefield.

Spam it like your life depends on it.

Every post should mention _AI_, _Agents_, and _how your startup is ushering in a
paradigm shift_.

If you’re feeling frisky, sprinkle in a little **blockchain** or
**neuro-symbolic architecture**. Doesn’t matter what it means — it just has to
_sound_ good.

---

### **Step 6: Monetization Strategy (a.k.a. Slap Stripe on It)**

Pricing is hard. Don’t do it.

Just plug in Stripe and pick three tiers that sound premium but mean absolutely
nothing:

- **$9.99/mo – Casual Prompting**: For hobbyists who want to feel like they're
  building the future while mostly generating Instagram captions.
- **$49.99/mo – Agentic Power User**: For serious prompters who demand their GPT
  calls come with dark mode and a dashboard.
- **$499.99/mo – Enterprise Quantum Prompting at Scale™**: For the C-suite exec
  who wants to show investors they’re “leveraging AI” without knowing what a
  prompt is.

Make sure to include a **fake annual discount** no one ever uses and a free
trial that requires a credit card _“for verification purposes.”_

---

### **Step 7: Exit Strategy (because why actually build anything?)**

Every proper PasS startup needs a clear endgame — ideally one that requires
minimal execution.

Here are your options:

- **Get acquired** by a Series Z startup run by a 14-year-old with a Discord
  server and a hype video.
- **Get “poached”** by a multi-billion dollar company as an “AI Prompting
  Expert”
- **Rebrand** as an _AI Infrastructure_ company. Say something along the lines
  of “we’re building tooling for agents to collaborate at scale” in investor
  calls until someone throws money at you. Bonus points if you make some
  LinkedIn posts.
- **Open-source it all** and post on Hacker News with the title: _“We built a
  $3M ARR PasS and shut it down to focus on our next project.”._ Now you might
  not get the money but at least you got the clout.

And that’s it.

You’re now running a successful PasS startup.

See you at the next AI summit fellow prompters.
